        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Mission: Impossible - Fallout</em> is my favorite movie of all time because it combines practical stunts, tight storytelling, great directing, and Tom Cruise. My favorite part is the amount of stunts and how they're all done by Cruise himself. The film follows Ethan Hunt as a failed mission sets off a chain of events that threatens global security, per usual, and Hunt stops it in the end.

          The movie looks incredible, and this is, in my opinion, due to the stunts. In MI: Dead Reckoning, there is more CGI, and the movie doesn't look as good in those moments, because you can clearly tell. When you can see Tom Cruise climbing a rope connected to a flying helicopter, the stakes are simply that much higher.

        <h2>Standout Set Piece</h2>
        <p>
          The finale of the movie set in the mountains with the helicopter fight is one of the greatest action scenes ever put on film. The set pieces, just the mountains themselves, look incredible.

          <p><strong>Extra:</strong> Tom Cruise actually learned how to fly a helicopter for this movie, just as he did with a fighter jet for Top Gun, another incredible Cruise flick.</p>

        <h2>Why It Works</h2>
        <p>
          The film is paced perfectly, which allows the audience to digest what they just saw, but not sit in it too long before the next piece of action comes along. I believe this may be the best paced movie ever made. I have seen over 1500 movies, and though that's not as many as others, I think I can still make a fair assessment on this. This is very much so helped by the fact that Cruise does everything himself, which allows the camera to make large pans and without a ton of camera cuts, as you don't need to shoot around the fact that it's not actually his face the audience would be seeing with a stunt double.

        <blockquote>
          "I'm an all-or-nothing kind of person, and when I become interested in something, I give it my all." - Tom Cruise
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This attitude held by Cruise is what makes this movie what it is, along with all the Mission Impossibles. Without someone willing to literally risk their life, these movies would not be what they are. Cruise is currently the only A-lister doing any action like this, and I will be deeply saddened when he is gone.
